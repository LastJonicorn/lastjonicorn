<h1> ðŸ‘‹ About Me </h1>
Hi! I'm a Bachelor of Business Information Technology graduate from Oulu University of Applied Sciences. I'm a fast learner, highly motivated, and always eager to dive into new technologies.

I bring a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, excellent English communication skills, and a solid background in customer-focused work. I thrive in environments where I can grow, contribute, and collaborate.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me hanging out with my pets or friends. I enjoy playing board and video games, as well as tinkering with personal projects in my spare time.
